 Imperial College Business School Capstone Competition November 2024


## Quick start

Visit the github repo at: https://github.com/claudio2323/Capstone-Competition-CF for the latest version of this code

1. Open week12_gpytorch.ipynb
2. Ensure variables are set with values function_num = 1 to 8 and num_week = is 1 to 11
3. Run the notebook each vblock of the notebook

## Overview

Folder structure: This project was integrated at a later stage to git, therefore the intial version control was done one file per week and the versions with changes in this project are: week1.ipynb,  week1_optuna.ipynb,week2.ipynb .... week8_gpytorch.ipynb .... to week12_gpytorch.ipynb

## Inputs

The competition demanded a systematic approach to data management and results analysis, which was implemented through a carefully designed processing pipeline. At the heart of this system was a  Jupyter notebook, results.ipynb, which served as the central hub for all data processing operations. This notebook contained a suite of custom functions designed to handle the weekly submission cycle and maintain the integrity of our optimization process.

## Outputs

directly in the weekly files
